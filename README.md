## Installation
Open a terminal, enter your project directory and execute the following command
to add this library to your dependencies:

```bash
composer require fleshgrinder/comparable
```

This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained in
the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) of the
Composer documentation.

## Usage

Open a terminal, enter the project directory and execute the following commands
to run the [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) tests with your locally installed
PHP executable. This requires that you have at least `make` 4.0 installed:

You can also execute the following two commands, in case `make` is not
available on your system, or too old:

```bash
composer install
composer test
```
